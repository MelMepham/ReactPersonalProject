    "about": "This is the biggest painting I have completed to date, it took about 12 months, and I used goache and pen. After hours and hours of painting this I spilt some of the paint on the image, not sure about what to do I sat there and stared at it for about 30 minutes. Knowing I had nothing to loose I decided to spill more paint on the image and experiemented with how I could use that. That element really added to the final product, and goes to show that mistakes are inevitable and have an amazing opportinuty to learn."
