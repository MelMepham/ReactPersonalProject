    about: "In spring 2017 Mel entered a competition to win a guest artist spot at The Misprint Co. and managed to be the people's choice! The Misprint Co. is a small Wellington based company aimed at getting waste paper from sources around the region and repurposing them into something usable. With so much waste in the world its so great to see creative solutions to re-purpose rather than recycle Photography by Jenny Buckler."
